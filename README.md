- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m @mlchrzan! ("Chrzan is pronounce "chr" like chirp and "zen" like the state of mind)
- 👀 I’m interested in studying networks, measurement, NLP, and causal methods in data science. I believe these are key to better understanding the interconnectedness of how institutions systematically operate and how those opreations can be better leveraged toward equitable outcomes. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about R and Python for data science. This quarter I'm getting into network methods and multilevel models as well as some NLP. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work involving robust education data sets, particually ones that have a unit of analysis at a district, state, or national level.
