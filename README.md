- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m @mlchrzan! ("Chrzan is pronounce "chr" like chirp and "zen" like the state of mind)
- 👀 I’m interested in using machine learning on social science problems to better model the lived complexities of our lives and improve meaningful results to drive positive change. I'm doing this through studying machine learning, deep learning, social networks, measurement, NLP, and causal methods in data science. I believe these are key to better understanding the interconnectedness of how institutions systematically operate and how those opreations can be better leveraged toward equitable outcomes for all. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about R and Python for data science. This quarter I'm getting into deep neural networks and causal methods as well as some NLP. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work involving robust education data sets, particually ones that have a unit of analysis at a district, state, or national level.
